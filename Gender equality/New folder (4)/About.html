<p>
1. Avoid derogatory language<br>
- avoiding derogatory languages is one of the effective ways to respect
a person.
<br>
<br>
2. Stereotyping<br>
- Avoid being a stereotype thinker, example of stereotyping in gender is
that "man is the breadwinner of the family".
<br>
<br>
3. Considirate<br>
- be considerate to the person's feeling so that you don't accidentally hurt
the person's feelings and beliefs.
<br>
<br>
4. Knowledge<br>
- know the facts. simply knowing the rules and laws about genders is a great help
to avoid discriminate others.

                        <p>
<p>
1. Avoid gender sterotyping.<br>
- Avoid having a notion that one gender is superior to the other gender or avoid thinking
that the other gender cant do what the other gender is doing.
<br>
<br>
2. Use media as a tool to promote.<br>
- In todays technology we use the media as a tool for promoting some things so why not use
it to help promote gender eqality more because people now focus more on the media.
<br>
<br>
3. Say something about what you see.<br>
- if you see something that concerns gender equality dont be afraid to voiceout your toughts
regarding the matter.
<br>
<br>
4. Treat both gender equally.<br>
- treat both gender with respect and treat both gender as if it is one.
