<h2>&emsp; Advocacy</h2>
<h3>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Advocacy program of the Saint Aloysius Gonzaga Parish is aimed to let people of the same gender<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;expand their thinking in what is gender equality. it is not teaching women to be like men but teaching women<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to take on roles that they CAN do. it is not teaching women to stop doing house duties and be employed.<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It is not teaching men that they can only do the work and they cannot do the house duties.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It is teaching men that house duties and employment is a shared responsibility.<br> 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We do these duties to ensure that men and women are aware about GENDER EQUALITY.
